  abstract = {Summary Epilepsy was defined conceptually in 2005 as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures. This definition is usually practically applied as having two unprovoked seizures >24 h apart. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) accepted recommendations of a task force altering the practical definition for special circumstances that do not meet the two unprovoked seizures criteria. The task force proposed that epilepsy be considered to be a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions: (1) At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60\%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who either had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past the applicable age or who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years and off antiseizure medicines for at least the last 5 years. “Resolved” is not necessarily identical to the conventional view of “remission or “cure.” Different practical definitions may be formed and used for various specific purposes. This revised definition of epilepsy brings the term in concordance with common use. A PowerPoint slide summarizing this article is available for download in the Supporting Information section here.},

abstract = {Summary
Epilepsy is one of the most common serious brain conditions, affecting over 70 million people worldwide. Its incidence has a bimodal distribution with the highest risk in infants and older age groups. Progress in genomic technology is exposing the complex genetic architecture of the common types of epilepsy, and is driving a paradigm shift. Epilepsy is a symptom complex with multiple risk factors and a strong genetic predisposition rather than a condition with a single expression and cause. These advances have resulted in the new classification of epileptic seizures and epilepsies. A detailed clinical history and a reliable eyewitness account of a seizure are the cornerstones of the diagnosis. Ancillary investigations can help to determine cause and prognosis. Advances in brain imaging are helping to identify the structural and functional causes and consequences of the epilepsies. Comorbidities are increasingly recognised as important aetiological and prognostic markers. Antiseizure medication might suppress seizures in up to two-thirds of all individuals but do not alter long-term prognosis. Epilepsy surgery is the most effective way to achieve long-term seizure freedom in selected individuals with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, but it is probably not used enough. With improved understanding of the gradual development of epilepsy, epigenetic determinants, and pharmacogenomics comes the hope for better, disease-modifying, or even curative, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies. Other developments are clinical implementation of seizure detection devices and new neuromodulation techniques, including responsive neural stimulation.}

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles published on the prevalence or incidence of epilepsy since 1985. Abstract, full-text review, and data abstraction were conducted in duplicate. Meta-analyses and meta-regressions were used to explore the association between prevalence or incidence, age group, sex, country level income, and study quality.Results: A total of 222 studies were included (197 on prevalence, 48 on incidence). The point prevalence of active epilepsy was 6.38 per 1,000 persons (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 5.57{\textendash}7.30), while the lifetime prevalence was 7.60 per 1,000 persons (95\% CI 6.17{\textendash}9.38). The annual cumulative incidence of epilepsy was 67.77 per 100,000 persons (95\% CI 56.69{\textendash}81.03) while the incidence rate was 61.44 per 100,000 person-years (95\% CI 50.75{\textendash}74.38). The prevalence of epilepsy did not differ by age group, sex, or study quality. The active annual period prevalence, lifetime prevalence, and incidence rate of epilepsy were higher in low to middle income countries. Epilepsies of unknown etiology and those with generalized seizures had the highest prevalence.Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive synthesis of the prevalence and incidence of epilepsy from published international studies and offers insight into factors that contribute to heterogeneity between estimates. Significant gaps (e.g., lack of incidence studies, stratification by age groups) were identified. Standardized reporting of future epidemiologic studies of epilepsy is needed.CI=confidence interval},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) represents a significant category of mortality in the population with chronic epilepsy. A consistent feature is that most of these deaths are unwitnessed. The aim was to identify witnessed deaths, examine the circumstances, and relate these findings to the proposed mechanisms for SUDEP. METHODS During the course of case ascertainment for a control study on SUDEP, witnessed deaths were identified and the circumstances examined in detail. Cases were notified by coroners, neurologists, and bereaved families. The findings were related to the proposed mechanisms for SUDEP which include central and obstructive apnoea and cardiac arrhythmia. RESULTS One hundred and thirty five SUDEP cases have been identified to date, of which 15 were witnessed deaths. Twelve deaths were associated with convulsive seizures, one collapse occurred 5 minutes after a generalised seizure, another collapse occurred after an aura and one patient died while in a probable post ictal state. Witnesses reported that 12 of the 15 cases experienced respiratory difficulty. CONCLUSIONS Most sudden epilepsy deaths are unwitnessed. Where witnessed most occur in association with a seizure and respiratory compromise is a prominent feature. Positioning or stimulation of respiration may be important in the prevention of these deaths.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is associated with a high rate of premature mortality from direct and indirect effects of seizures, epilepsy, and antiseizure therapies. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the second leading neurologic cause of total lost potential life-years after stroke, yet SUDEP may account for less than half of all epilepsy-related deaths. Some epilepsy groups are especially vulnerable: individuals from low socioeconomic status groups and those with comorbid psychiatric illness die more often than controls. Despite clear evidence of an important public health problem, efforts to assess and prevent epilepsy-related deaths remain inadequate. We discuss factors contributing to the underestimation of SUDEP and other epilepsy-related causes of death. We suggest the need for a systematic classification of deaths directly due to epilepsy (e.g., SUDEP, drowning), due to acute symptomatic seizures, and indirectly due to epilepsy (e.g., suicide, chronic effects of antiseizure medications). Accurately estimating the frequency of epilepsy-related mortality is essential to support the development and assessment of preventive interventions. We propose that educational interventions and public health campaigns targeting medication adherence, psychiatric comorbidity, and other modifiable risk factors may reduce epilepsy-related mortality. Educational campaigns regarding sudden infant death syndrome and fires, which kill far fewer Americans than epilepsy, have been widely implemented. We have done too little to prevent epilepsy-related deaths. Everyone with epilepsy and everyone who treats people with epilepsy need to know that controlling seizures will save lives.AED=antiepileptic drug; COD=cause of death; PWE=people with epilepsy; SIDS=sudden infant death syndrome; SMR=standardized mortality rate; SUDEP=sudden unexpected death in epilepsy; TCS=tonic-clonic seizures},

The purpose of such a revision is to recognize that some seizure types can have either a focal or generalized onset, to allow classification when the onset is unobserved, to include some missing seizure types, and to adopt more transparent names. Because current knowledge is insufficient to form a scientifically based classification, the 2017 Classification is operational (practical) and based on the 1981 Classification, extended in 2010. Changes include the following: (1) “partial” becomes “focal”; (2) awareness is used as a classifier of focal seizures; (3) the terms dyscognitive, simple partial, complex partial, psychic, and secondarily generalized are eliminated; (4) new focal seizure types include automatisms, behavior arrest, hyperkinetic, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional; (5) atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, and tonic seizures can be of either focal or generalized onset; (6) focal to bilateral tonic–clonic seizure replaces secondarily generalized seizure; (7) new generalized seizure types are absence with eyelid myoclonia, myoclonic absence, myoclonic–atonic, myoclonic–tonic–clonic; and (8) seizures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified. The new classification does not represent a fundamental change, but allows greater flexibility and transparency in naming seizure types.},

abstract = {Summary
The epilepsies are one of the most common serious brain disorders, can occur at all ages, and have many possible presentations and causes. Although incidence in childhood has fallen over the past three decades in developed countries, this reduction is matched by an increase in elderly people. Monogenic Mendelian epilepsies are rare. A clinical syndrome often has multiple possible genetic causes, and conversely, different mutations in one gene can lead to various epileptic syndromes. Most common epilepsies, however, are probably complex traits with environmental effects acting on inherited susceptibility, mediated by common variation in particular genes. Diagnosis of epilepsy remains clinical, and neurophysiological investigations assist with diagnosis of the syndrome. Brain imaging is making great progress in identifying the structural and functional causes and consequences of the epilepsies. Current antiepileptic drugs suppress seizures without influencing the underlying tendency to generate seizures, and are effective in 60–70% of individuals. Pharmacogenetic studies hold the promise of being able to better individualise treatment for each patient, with maximum possibility of benefit and minimum risk of adverse effects. For people with refractory focal epilepsy, neurosurgical resection offers the possibility of a life-changing cure. Potential new treatments include precise prediction of seizures and focal therapy with drug delivery, neural stimulation, and biological grafts.}

ABSTRACT={Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is an adjunctive treatment for patients suffering from inoperable drug-resistant epilepsy. Although a complete understanding of the mediators involved in the antiepileptic effects of VNS and their complex interactions is lacking, VNS is known to trigger the release of neurotransmitters that have seizure-suppressing effects. In particular, norepinephrine (NE) is a neurotransmitter that has been associated with the clinical effects of VNS by preventing seizure development and by inducing long-term plastic changes that could restore a normal function of the brain circuitry. However, the biological requisites to become responder to VNS are still unknown. In this review, we report evidence of the critical involvement of NE in the antiepileptic effects of VNS in rodents and humans. Moreover, we emphasize the hypothesis that the functional integrity of the noradrenergic system could be a determining factor to obtain clinical benefits from the therapy. Finally, encouraging avenues of research involving NE in VNS treatment are discussed. These could lead to the personalization of the stimulation parameters to maximize the antiepileptic effects and potentially improve the response rate to the therapy.}

The overall framework of the definition has two “hierarchical” levels: Level 1 provides a general scheme to categorize response to each therapeutic intervention, including a minimum dataset of knowledge about the intervention that would be needed; Level 2 provides a core definition of drug resistant epilepsy using a set of essential criteria based on the categorization of response (from Level 1) to trials of antiepileptic drugs. It is proposed as a testable hypothesis that drug resistant epilepsy is defined as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated, appropriately chosen and used antiepileptic drug schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom. This definition can be further refined when new evidence emerges. The rationale behind the definition and the principles governing its proper use are discussed, and examples to illustrate its application in clinical practice are provided.},

Surgery is widely accepted as an effective therapy for selected individuals with medically refractory epilepsy. Numerous studies in the past 20 years have reported seizure freedom for at least 1 year in 53–84% of patients after anteromesial temporal lobe resections for mesial temporal lobe sclerosis, in 66–100% of patients with dual pathology, in 36–76% of patients with localised neocortical epilepsy, and in 43–79% of patients after hemispherectomies. Reported rates for non-resective surgery have been less impressive in terms of seizure freedom; however, the benefit is more apparent when reported in terms of significant seizure reductions. In this Review, we consider the outcomes of surgery in adults and children with epilepsy and review studies of neurological and cognitive sequelae, psychiatric and behavioural outcomes, and overall health-related quality of life.}

Brief bursts of acetylcholine and norepinephrine can enhance the neural plasticity associated with coincident events. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) represents a safe and effective means to trigger the release of these neuromodulators with a high degree of temporal control. VNS-event pairing can generate highly specific and long-lasting plasticity in sensory and motor cortex. Based on the capacity to drive specific changes in neural circuitry, VNS paired with experience has been successful in effectively ameliorating animal models of chronic tinnitus, stroke, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Targeted plasticity therapy utilizing VNS is currently being translated to humans to treat chronic tinnitus and improve motor recovery after stroke. This chapter will discuss the current progress of VNS paired with experience to drive specific plasticity to treat these neurological disorders and will evaluate additional future applications of targeted plasticity therapy.}

Results have shown that VNS can modulate different types of memory depending the protocol of stimulation in non-demented patients after both short term and chronic VNS application. Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS), which is a non-invasive method of VNS, opens up new perspectives for different clinical applications.}

ABSTRACT={The vagus nerve (VN) is the longest nerve of the organism and a major component of the parasympathetic nervous system which constitutes the autonomic nervous system (ANS), with the sympathetic nervous system. There is classically an equilibrium between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems which is responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis. An imbalance of the ANS is observed in various pathologic conditions. The VN, a mixed nerve with 4/5 afferent and 1/5 efferent fibers, is a key component of the neuro-immune and brain-gut axes through a bidirectional communication between the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A dual anti-inflammatory role of the VN is observed using either vagal afferents, targeting the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, or vagal efferents, targeting the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. The sympathetic nervous system and the VN act in synergy, through the splenic nerve, to inhibit the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) by macrophages of the peripheral tissues and the spleen. Because of its anti-inflammatory effect, the VN is a therapeutic target in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders where TNFα is a key component. In this review, we will focus on the anti-inflammatory role of the VN in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The anti-inflammatory properties of the VN could be targeted pharmacologically, with enteral nutrition, by VN stimulation (VNS), with complementary medicines or by physical exercise. VNS is one of the alternative treatments for drug resistant epilepsy and depression and one might think that VNS could be used as a non-drug therapy to treat inflammatory disorders of the GI tract, such as IBD, irritable bowel syndrome, and postoperative ileus, which are all characterized by a blunted autonomic balance with a decreased vagal tone.}

Side effects (hoarseness, stimulation sensation in the neck, and hiccups) were transient and occurred concomitantly with stimulation. All patients tolerated increasing stimulation parameters well. The results, however, are inconclusive because of the brief duration (6–12 months) of follow-up. Vagal stimulation represents a novel approach for seizure control in patients who have intractable epilepsy, but additional studies are needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of the procedure and to define selection criteria for patients.},

abstract = {Abstract The projections of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) were studied by autoradiographic anterograde fiber-tracing and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde cell-labeling. Tritiated proline and leucine were deposited in electrophysiologically identified regions of NST. Injections of NST at levels caudal to where the vagus enters the nucleus, from which responses were evoked by stimulation of cranial nerves IX and X, revealed topographically organized bilateral projections to, most prominently, the ventrolateral medullary reticular formation which contains neurons of the ambiguus complex, and to the lateral and medial parabrachial nuclei, including a small portion of the medially adjacent central gray substance. Labeled fibers in the ventrolateral reticular formation were present from the nucleus retroambigualis rostralward to the retrofacial nucleus, with the densest concentration located over the nucleus ambiguus proper. The parabrachial projection was confirmed using HRP and shown to originiate from cells in the medial subdivision of NST. Due to the problem of fibers en passant, it was not possible to interpret conclusively the cell-labeling seen around the solitary tract after HRP injections made in the region of the nucleus ambiguus. Labeled fibers were also traced from caudal NST to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, but their origin could not be determined with certainty. Other labeled axons, traced to circumscribed parts of the inferior olivary complex and via the contralateral medial lemniscus to VPL of the thalamus, were shown in HRP experiments to originate from the dorsal column nuclei rather than NST. No labeled fibers were traced into the spinal cord, nor were any cells labeled in NST after large HRP deposits in upper cervical segments. Isotope deposits at levels of NST rostral to the entrance of the vagus, from which responses were evoked by rapid stimulation of the tongue, revealed an ipsilateral projection which ascends as a component of the central tegmental tract to the parvicellular part of the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus (VPMpc). After small HRP deposits in VPMpc, labeled cells in NST were restricted to the rostral part of the lateral subdivision. No labeled axons were traced from rostral NST to the ambiguus complex or parabrachial area. Injections of 3H-amino acids at intermediate levels of NST resulted in fiber-labeling in VPMpc, the parabrachial area, and the ambiguus complex.},

abstract = {Summary
Purpose
To unravel the mechanism of action of neurostimulation as a treatment for seizures, functional neuroimaging tools allow minimally invasive research in humans. We performed single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with epilepsy, treated with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at the time of initial stimulation as well as after chronic treatment were correlated with long-term clinical efficacy.
Methods
In this pilot study, 27 patients (14 female and 13 male) who were treated with VNS at Ghent University Hospital for refractory epilepsy underwent a 99mTc-ECD (ethyl cystein dimer) SPECT activation study at the time the first stimulation train was administered. 12 patients underwent an additional 99mTc-ECD SPECT activation study 6 months later. Image acquisition was performed on a high-resolution triple-headed gamma camera. Significant rCBF changes were correlated with prospectively assessed clinical efficacy data.
Results
Significant rCBF changes were found in the thalamus, the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus. Acute limbic hyper-perfusion and chronic thalamic hypo-perfusion correlate with positive clinical efficacy.
Conclusions
Acute and chronic electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve induces rCBF changes that can be measured by SPECT on a group-basis. The thalamus and the limbic system are thought to play a key role in the mechanism of action of VNS.}

Ascending projections from the caudal (general-visceroceptive) part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) were studied experimentally in the rat by the aid of the anterograde autoradiographic and the retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracer techniques. Microelectrophoretic deposits of tritiated proline and leucine which involved the caudal part of the NTS, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (dmX), and portions of the hypoglossal nucleus, nucleus intercalatus and/or nucleus gracilis were found to label ascending fibers that, besides going to numerous brain stem territories that included prominently the parabrachial area, could also be traced to several forebrain structures, namely, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), the paraventricular (PA), dorsomedial (HDM) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei of the hypothalamus, the central nucleus of the amygdaloid complex (AC), the medial preoptic area (PM) and the periventricular nucleus of the thalamus (TPV). Smaller isotope injections almost completely confined to the NTS and dmX resulted in lighter labeling of a similar set of parabrachial and forebrain projections, whereas in another case, in which the deposit was almost exclusively limited to the nucleus gracilis, no label was seen in the aforementioned structures. In another series of experiments, aimed at further localizing the neurons of origin of the prosencephalic projections under consideration, small microelectrophoretic HRP injections confined almost totally to BST, PA, HDM, AC, PM or TPV, as well as both small and large injections involving ARC, resulted in labeled neurons situated in the dorsal medullary region, mainly in the medial portion of the NTS at the level of and caudal to the area postrema. Taken together, these observations indicate for the first time the existence of relatively direct conduction lines by which interoceptive information might be conveyed to limbic forebrain structures; some of the possible physiological correlates of these anatomical findings are discussed.}

abstract = {Summary: Purpose: The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is a primary site at which vagal afferents terminate. Because afferent vagal nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to have anticonvulsant effects, it is likely that changes in synaptic transmission in the NTS can regulate seizure susceptibility. We tested this hypothesis by examining the influence of γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA) ergic and glutamatergic transmission in the NTS on seizures evoked by systemic and focal bicuculline and systemic pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in rats. Methods: Muscimol (256 pmol), a GABAA-receptor agonist, bicuculline methiodide (177 pmol), a GABAA-receptor antagonist, kynurenate (634 pmol), a glutamate-receptor antagonist, or lidocaine (100 nl; 5\%), a local anesthetic, was microinjected into the mediocaudal (m)NTS. Ten minutes later, seizure activity was induced by either a focal microinfusion of bicuculline methiodide (177 pmol) into the rostral piriform cortex, systemic PTZ (50 mg/kg, i.p.), or systemic bicuculline (0.35 mg/kg, i.v.). Results: Muscimol in mNTS (but not in adjacent regions of NTS) attenuated seizures in all seizure models tested, whereas bicuculline methiodide into mNTS did not alter seizure responses. Kynurenate infusions into mNTS significantly reduced the severity of seizures evoked both systemically and focally. Anticonvulsant effects also were obtained with lidocaine application into the same region of mNTS. Unilateral injections were sufficient to afford seizure protection. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that an increase in GABA transmission or a decrease in glutamate transmission in the rat mNTS reduces susceptibility to limbic motor seizures. This suggests that inhibition of mNTS outputs enhances seizure resistance in the forebrain and provides a potential mechanism for the seizure protection obtained with vagal stimulation.},

Methods: Five patients (three women, two men; mean age, 35.4 years) who were treated for medically refractory epilepsy with VNS, underwent fMRI. All patients had a nonfocal brain MRI. The VNS was set at 30 Hz, 0.5–2.0 mA for intervals of activation of 30 s on and 30 s off, during which the fMRI was performed. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to determine significant areas of activation or inhibition during vagal nerve stimulation (p < 0.05). Results: VNS-induced activation was detected in the thalami bilaterally (left more than right), insular cortices bilaterally, ipsilateral basal ganglia and postcentral gyri, right posterior superior temporal gyrus, and inferomedial occipital gyri (left more than right). The most robust activation was seen in the thalami (left more than right) and insular cortices. Conclusions: VNS-induced thalamic and insular cortical activation during fMRI suggests that these areas may play a role in modulating cerebral cortical activity, and the observed decrease in seizure frequency in patients who are given VNS may be a consequence of this increased activation.},

Since the therapeutic effect of VNS may be mediated by afferent projections to the thalamus, we tested the hypothesis that intrinsic thalamocortical connectivity is associated with seizure response following chronic VNS in children with epilepsy. Twenty-one children (ages 5–21years) with medically-intractable epilepsy underwent resting-state fMRI prior to implantation of VNS. Ten received sedation, while 11 did not. Whole brain connectivity to thalamic regions of interest was performed. Multivariate generalized linear models were used to correlate resting-state data with seizure outcomes, while adjusting for age and sedation status. A supervised support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to classify response to chronic VNS on the basis of intrinsic connectivity. Of the 21 subjects, 11 (52%) had 50% or greater improvement in seizure control after VNS. Enhanced connectivity of the thalami to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left insula was associated with greater VNS efficacy. Within our test cohort, SVM correctly classified response to chronic VNS with 86% accuracy. In an external cohort of 8 children, the predictive model correctly classified the seizure response with 88% accuracy. We find that enhanced intrinsic connectivity within thalamocortical circuitry is associated with seizure response following VNS. These results encourage the study of intrinsic connectivity to inform neural network-based, personalized treatment decisions for children with intractable epilepsy.}

abstract = {Objective Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a common treatment for medically intractable epilepsy, but response rates are highly variable, with no preoperative means of identifying good candidates. This study aimed to predict VNS response using structural and functional connectomic profiling. Methods Fifty-six children, comprising discovery (n = 38) and validation (n = 18) cohorts, were recruited from 3 separate institutions. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to identify group differences in white matter microstructure, which in turn informed beamforming of resting-state magnetoencephalography recordings. The results were used to generate a support vector machine learning classifier, which was independently validated. This algorithm was compared to a second classifier generated using 31 clinical covariates. Results Treatment responders demonstrated greater fractional anisotropy in left thalamocortical, limbic, and association fibers, as well as greater connectivity in a functional network encompassing left thalamic, insular, and temporal nodes (p < 0.05). The resulting classifier demonstrated 89.5\% accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 on 10-fold cross-validation. In the external validation cohort, this model demonstrated an accuracy of 83.3\%, with a sensitivity of 85.7\% and specificity of 75.0\%. This was significantly superior to predictions using clinical covariates alone, which exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.57 (p < 0.008). Interpretation This study provides the first multi-institutional, multimodal connectomic prediction algorithm for VNS, and provides new insights into its mechanism of action. Reliable identification of VNS responders is critical to mitigate surgical risks for children who may not benefit, and to ensure cost-effective allocation of health care resources.

abstract = {Summary The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Classification of the Epilepsies has been updated to reflect our gain in understanding of the epilepsies and their underlying mechanisms following the major scientific advances that have taken place since the last ratified classification in 1989. As a critical tool for the practicing clinician, epilepsy classification must be relevant and dynamic to changes in thinking, yet robust and translatable to all areas of the globe. Its primary purpose is for diagnosis of patients, but it is also critical for epilepsy research, development of antiepileptic therapies, and communication around the world. The new classification originates from a draft document submitted for public comments in 2013, which was revised to incorporate extensive feedback from the international epilepsy community over several rounds of consultation. It presents three levels, starting with seizure type, where it assumes that the patient is having epileptic seizures as defined by the new 2017 ILAE Seizure Classification. After diagnosis of the seizure type, the next step is diagnosis of epilepsy type, including focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, combined generalized, and focal epilepsy, and also an unknown epilepsy group. The third level is that of epilepsy syndrome, where a specific syndromic diagnosis can be made. The new classification incorporates etiology along each stage, emphasizing the need to consider etiology at each step of diagnosis, as it often carries significant treatment implications. Etiology is broken into six subgroups, selected because of their potential therapeutic consequences. New terminology is introduced such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The term benign is replaced by the terms self-limited and pharmacoresponsive, to be used where appropriate. It is hoped that this new framework will assist in improving epilepsy care and research in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, we have observed a revolution in brain structural and functional Connectomics. On one hand, we have an ever-more detailed characterization of the brain's white matter structural connectome. On the other, we have a repertoire of consistent functional networks that form and dissipate over time during rest. Despite the evident spatial similarities between structural and functional connectivity, understanding how different time-evolving functional networks spontaneously emerge from a single structural network requires analyzing the problem from the perspective of complex network dynamics and dynamical system's theory. In that direction, bottom-up computational models are useful tools to test theoretical scenarios and depict the mechanisms at the genesis of resting-state activity. Here, we provide an overview of the different mechanistic scenarios proposed over the last decade via computational models. Importantly, we highlight the need of incorporating additional model constraints considering the properties observed at finer temporal scales with MEG and the dynamical properties of FC in order to refresh the list of candidate scenarios.}

abstract = {There is an unmet need to develop robust predictive algorithms to preoperatively identify pediatric epilepsy patients who will respond to vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Given the similarity in the neural circuitry between vagus and median nerve afferent projections to the primary somatosensory cortex, the current study hypothesized that median nerve somatosensory evoked field(s) (SEFs) could be used to predict seizure response to VNS. Retrospective data from forty-eight pediatric patients who underwent VNS at two different institutions were used in this study. Thirty-six patients (“Discovery Cohort”) underwent preoperative electrical median nerve stimulation during magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and 12 patients (“Validation Cohort”) underwent preoperative pneumatic stimulation during MEG. SEFs and their spatial deviation, waveform amplitude and latency, and event-related connectivity were calculated for all patients. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained on the Discovery Cohort to differentiate responders from non-responders based on these input features and tested on the Validation Cohort by comparing the model-predicted response to VNS to the known response. We found that responders to VNS had significantly more widespread SEF localization and greater functional connectivity within limbic and sensorimotor networks in response to median nerve stimulation. No difference in SEF amplitude or latencies was observed between the two cohorts. The SVM classifier demonstrated 88.9% accuracy (0.93 area under the receiver operator characteristics curve) on cross-validation, which decreased to 67% in the Validation cohort. By leveraging overlapping neural circuitry, we found that median nerve SEF characteristics and functional connectivity could identify responders to VNS.}

abstract = {Myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE) is characterized by multiple seizure types, which are often refractory. Although vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an alternative treatment for medically intractable seizures, its exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Herein, we report the case of a 4-year-old boy with intractable MAE who has been in a seizure-free status for 2 years and 3 months since 6 months after the implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator (Model 103, Cyberonics, Inc., Houston, TX). Various test results 6 months after VNS were compared with those before VNS. Results of an electroencephalograph revealed disappearance of epileptiform discharges and an increased beta–gamma spectrum rhythm. The brain diffusion-tensor imaging showed an increased ratio of fraction anisotropy in the right fimbria–fornix, indicating improved diffusion of the white matter tract, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed globally improved cerebral glucose metabolism. His cognitive and social–emotional performances also improved at 2 years after VNS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the effects of VNS on fimbria–fornix and glucose metabolism in MAE.}
